_I, Charybdis_ is an interactive virtual reality experience for Meta Quest 2 developed by Carisa Antariksa, Jordanne Chan, and Sheilla Shojaie at Bodies in Play, a research-creation partnership between OCAD Universityâ€™s game:play Lab and Social Body Lab, and DMG in summer 2023. 

To be a whirlpool from the first-person perspective, drawing in and casting away your surroundings, gives expression to themes of non-human representation, embodiments of fear and agency, and the roles of women in mythology.
